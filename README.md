**NOTE**

This project was migrated to [Eclipse Gitlab](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/it/websites/events.eclipse.org) on October 14, 2021.

The [events.eclipse.org](https://events.eclipse.org) website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

The site provides date, time and place for the various events (conferences, demo camps, special days, hackathons and trainings) for the Eclipse ecosystem, displayed on a convenient map of the world.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8d42015f-09c7-46b1-9f9c-419404d01f6d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eclipsefdn/deploys)

## Getting started

Install dependencies, build assets and start a webserver:

```bash
npm install 
hugo server
```

## Request an Event Website

Missing your event on this site? Please submit your event to the [Eclipse Newsroom](https://newsroom.eclipse.org/node/add/events).

Eclipse Foundation Staff can request an Event website similar to [Open Source AI Workshop](https://events.eclipse.org/2020/open-source-ai-workshop/) by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/events.eclipse.org/issues/new?template=event.md). 

The Eclipse Foundation Webdev team will start working on your request once the [Event Website Content Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVLBK8tzyuYC9OUisy1x-cc50PfGx0alnUHw9RYlZag) is completed and uploaded to your issue.

Please plan for a minimum of two weeks for the website implementation. Additional information is available in the [Event Website Content Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVLBK8tzyuYC9OUisy1x-cc50PfGx0alnUHw9RYlZag) document.
