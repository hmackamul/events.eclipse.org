## Speaker Guide  

Welcome to the SAAM Mobility 2021 speaker guide! We are here to support our presenters and make sure that your experience is positive, stress-free, and as technically smooth as possible. This guide is an important part of that support. Please be sure to read it before you attend your speaker tech-check during the first week of September (see below for more about the tech-checks).

As always, if you have questions, comments, or need help, email us at research@eclipse.org We are here to help!

## Presenting at SAAM Mobility  

SAAM Mobility will be presented on Zoom with the option of pre-recording your talk. Even if you pre-record your talk, you will need to plan to be online during the broadcast of your talk so that you can answer questions from attendees during the Q&A session at the end. You can [test Zoom here](https://zoom.us/test) if you don’t have access to an account.

Each paper presentation session is 20 minutes, including 5 minutes for questions. Please limit your talk to no more than 15 minutes to allow for the 5 minute Q&A session at the end. 

There will be a moderator for each of the presentations. The moderator will monitor the session chat, and if required, will pass questions to you for the Q&A at the end.

Demo presentations are 15 minutes, including 5 minutes for questions. 

For posters, each team will have 5 minutes to present your posters, followed by a session for open discussion.

### Speaker Tech-Checks

We are asking each speaker to sign up for a short, group session for an equipment and environment check. Sessions will be scheduled June 7 and June 8.  Please sign up for a time slot on the foodle link you received by email.

### Presentation Environment and Best Practices

Presenting successfully to a virtual audience involves the right setup and lots of practice, even for experienced in-person speakers. The [Presentation Environment and Best Practices](../presentation-environment) document summarizes best practices and space recommendations that will help you deliver a dynamic and engaging talk.

### Equipment

The [Presentation Environment and Best Practices](../presentation-environment) document contains our equipment recommendations, including specific items to purchase if you plan to upgrade your existing setup.   

### Pre-Recording  

If you would like to pre-record your talk, please remember that recordings need to be submitted no later than June 7, 2021. We would be happy to receive the recordings earlier. If you plan to pre-record your talk, please contact research@eclipse.org for more instructions on uploading. 

You can use Zoom to record your talk. This [support article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording) from Zoom is an excellent summary of the process. 


### Speaker Agreement

All presenters (papers, demos, posters) will be asked to sign the Eclipse SAAM Mobility speaker agreement. If you have not yet signed the speaker agreement please contact research@eclipse.org.  

### Presentation Template

We've created a [cover page slide template](cover-page-template.pptx) for the conference. It is optional but we hope you will find it useful!   

### Poster preview (due June 4, 2021)

We would like to publish your poster along with a description on our website to allow participants to preview the posters and decide which poster session to attend. We will need your final poster and description by June 4, 2021.  

### Instructions for submitting camera-ready (due June 8, 2021)

Please submit the final version of your paper by registering for camera-ready in the EasyChair portal and uploading there, using [this link](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=esaamm2021#). You will also need to upload a signed author agreement.

Before uploading:

	* [AUTHOR-AGREEMENT (NTP)](http://ceur-ws.org/ceur-author-agreement-ccby-ntp.pdf?ver=2020-03-02): Authors shall use this form if they included no copyrighted third party material in their paper text (or accompanying sources, datasets). This is the right variant in most cases.
