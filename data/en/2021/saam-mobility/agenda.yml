              <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our world is changing, and the change is visible everywhere. More than 50% of the population is living in
              cities and the cities are growing. More and more goods and people need to be transported, bringing the
              traffic infrastructure to its limits. Increasing pollution and noise levels bringing the environment to its
              limits. <br/>
              To counter this, a transformation of the mobility is needed, who has already started, powered by new
              technologies and services. The mobility of the future will be electrified, connected, personalized,
              automated and software defined.<br/>
              Software is more and more dominating our daily life, also in the automotive world. Almost every
              function in the vehicle is defined by software. Autonomous Driving solutions introduce a new complexity
              into the development of embedded systems in the vehicle. This complexity rises with each level of
              control and autonomy of the automated driving systems and you need deeper expertise and more
              software. Software is more and more becoming an important differentiator for autonomous vehicles.
              Increasing embedded software complexity with an increase in level of automation is putting new
              demands on the existing tools and frameworks. Instead of solving these challenges alone, partnering in
              non-differentiating areas and collaborating is the path forward.</p>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Humans are very good at adapting to and driving in very different conditions and environments. Complex AI based
              software such as Autonomous vehicles (AV) are biased by the training data and they do not do well in different 
              contexts. Environment perception and context awareness can be used to adapt and deploy complex networks of AI 
              systems that are expected to perform safely on many different environments and edge cases. Typical Autonomous 
              Drive (AD) software stacks provide localization, object detection and tracking using an array of sensor data. 
              Additional sources of information such as V2X connectivity, passenger behavior, person-to-device mapping, urban 
              context, degradation of traffic etc. complements the sensor data that can be used to describe a context. 
              This context is used to predict and adapt the system of software and applications that are deployed to the vehicle.<br/>
              Context Aware Software Stack for Mobility (CASSM) describes a model based approach for definition of a software stack 
              for complex systems such as those found in autonomous vehicles. Machine Learning is used to detect a context and adapt 
              the software stack, which can then be used to identify and deploy services to autonomous vehicles. CASSM will be an 
              open source in-vehicle delivery of context-driven services and applications. This paper describes an architecture to 
              define context-aware personalized & dynamically provisioned capabilities, applications & services to autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/></p>

              <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anand Prakash, Lukas Krawczyk and Carsten Wolff<br/><br/>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> The computational demands of safety critical ADAS applications on autonomous vehicles have been ever-increasing. 
              As a result, high performance computing nodes with varying operating frequencies, and inclusion of different sensors have 
              been introduced, which has resulted in introduction of heterogeneous architectures with high complexity.  This complexity 
              has led to challenges in analysing a system’s timing behavior, such as determining the end-to-end response time of 
              high-level functionality as well as a real-time application’s latency. The existing approaches in analysing the timing 
              behavior of an ADAS application does not address the overall end-to-end response time. It is also worth mentioning that 
              a practical timing verification of an ADAS in a real-life scenario is still an open issue. <br/>
              This talk provides an overview of the existing RC car platforms along with its comparison to the proposed RC car 
              demonstrator platform. It focuses on the model based architectural design of RC car demonstrator as well as the 
              event-chain task model, which is coarsely based on Waters Challenge 2019. Further, it lays emphasis on deriving 
              the timing parameter metrics from the generated trace file, which can be used to evaluate the system behavior 
              against the timing requirements. Finally, the talk concludes with the importance on designing an ADAS with a 
              model-based approach. This will enable a better, faster and modular analysis of a safety critical ADAS application.<br/><br/></p>

              <p>Author: Mikko Rajanen <br/><br/>
              <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes a list of potential benefits of better usability and user experience 
              adapted to automated driving and autonomous mobility. These benefits could be useful for understanding and communicating 
              the importance of usability and user experience for the success of automated driving to be accepted by the non-technical 
              public and becoming mainstream and successful. In this paper, the focus is on identifying usability and user experience 
              benefits of human-machine interaction (HMI) in automated driving context. The goal of the paper is to legitimize the 
              usability and the user experience activities in the eyes of the management of automated driving application and HMI 
              development organizations. The user-centered design process focuses on users, their needs and requirements. This paper 
              shows that the benefits of better usability and user experience through user-centered design can be identified in use 
              context as well as application development context through competitive advantage, reduced risks, and reduced development 
              costs.<br/><br/></p>

              <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mobility landscape is undergoing significant changes. More and more mobility providers compete
              for customers with their own mobility services. Traditional public transport, demand responsive transport, 
              taxis, car sharing, ride pooling, bike sharing, e-scooters,  … the available modes of transport in cities 
              are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and confusing. At the same time, significant changes to the landscape 
              are induced by the effects of the global pandemic. They may lead to even more drastic changes in the mobility 
              demand.</p>
              <p>How to tame the complexity of this landscape and fight the climate change without neglecting mobility as a 
              fundamental human need is an open - albeit essential - question.</p>
              <p>In this talk, we will examine the changes in the mobility landscape and look at the role of two important 
              players in this discussion: open simulators and artificial intelligence. What do they bring to the table 
              in order to tackle the rising complexity? How can they be applied to improve the transportation system in 
              a city? The Eclipse SUMO project is used as an example to illustrate how to build digital twins of smart cities. 
              Moreover, results from recent research projects are used to discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of applying 
              artificial intelligence to optimize transportation systems.</p>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern internal combustion engines have several advanced exhaust treatment systems to meet emission standards and 
              legislation. In case of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for diesel engines, a catalyst (“AdBlue®”) is used as 
              consumable. This incurs costs for the operator of diesel vehicles and provides an incentive to unlawfully circumvent 
              and shut down those systems. This case study presents how the Eclipse KUKSA stack has been used to realize an 
              anti-tampering system for commercial heavy-duty trucks exhaust systems. We show how the in-vehicle KUKSA.val software 
              and the KUKSA.cloud components can be used to collect relevant data from a real heavy-duty truck and send them to the 
              cloud for further analysis.<br/><br/></p>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, we explored how the Eclipse Kuksa framework could be used as a technology basis for building an intelligent 
              moving test platform to support research of autonomous vehicles and vehicle related research in general. Based on the gained 
              experience, we state that Kuksa framework is a feasible basis for development of open, intelligent automotive data systems, 
              though with a considerable learning needs. We present the experience gained during this study and demonstrate some of the 
              functionality provided by a minimum-viable system we implemented in the study.<br/><br/></p>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Hono™ service stack deployment to Azure was a student project by the SMADYASP (Smart Autonomous Driving Yet Another Student Project) group, in which the goal was to create 
              cloud infrastructure architecture for mobility applications. Microsoft Azure was used as the cloud platform, and deployment was 
              done using Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes. With the results of the project, it is now much easier to deploy Hono™ and monitor 
              and trace the whole service stack. In the future, this project's results are used in setting up a test environment for real 
              automotive scenarios concerning in-vehicle and 5G connectivity mobility applications. <br/>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> A major problem with vehicles used in densely populated areas is parking. Part of the problem is the scarcity of the 
              resource in busy areas and the non optimal utilization of private spots. We propose the 'Smart Shared Private Parking' 
              model that aims at including in the parking pool also private parking spots. In an urban area with both commercial and 
              residential buildings, frequently household owners do not utilize their own parking lots during office hours, long duration 
              of shopping and vacations. At the same time, such owners want to be able to park in their lots when needed. Therefore, to 
              engage the residents and allow them to provide their parking spaces when unused one needs a real-time, distributed infrastructure 
              that supports dynamic allocation of spaces. We propose a conceptual deployment of edge hardware and communication mechanisms to 
              enable shared private parking sharing. We illustrate an infrastructure setup required to analyse various aspects of the model 
              and show its effectiveness in parking allocation in terms of vehicular emission, utilisation rate, and revenue as metrics 
              considering all the stakeholders. A simulation based on a district of Dublin provides quantitative instances for these metrics.<br/><br/></p>

              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Future vehicles can be considered as ”IoT devices on wheels” as they exhibit high-performance computation resources, 
              various sensing devices, and a data-driven software architecture. While the availability of automotive big data provides 
              the basis for innovative and disruptive mobility services, processing vehicle data within the cloud poses also several 
              challenges. A major challenge in this context is the validation of cloud-native mobility services regarding their proper 
              functionality and the fulfillment of non-functional requirements. Due to the cost-efficient nature of simulations, traffic 
              simulation in combination with network simulation is more and more used for a virtual proof-ofconcept of mobility services 
              and their software architectures. Nevertheless, the creation of adequate simulation environments specific to connected 
              vehicle scenarios is time-consuming and requires explicit domain knowledge. We present a prototypical domain-specific 
              language tailored to the formal description of connected vehicle scenarios and the according generation of simulation 
              environments. Therefore, we make use of the traffic simulator Eclipse SUMO as well as the co-simulation environment Eclipse 
              MOSAIC and demonstrate the usage of our DSL via the use case of a restricted traffic zone. Although the DSL so far only 
              support the setup of minimal traffic scenarios, it already helps to abstract complexity and ease the set-up of simulation 
              environments for connected vehicle scenarios.<br/><br/></p>
