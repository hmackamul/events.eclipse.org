             <p>Our world is changing, and the change is visible everywhere. More than 50% of the population is living in
              cities and the cities are growing. More and more goods and people need to be transported, bringing the
              traffic infrastructure to its limits. Increasing pollution and noise levels bringing the environment to its
              limits. <br/>
              To counter this, a transformation of the mobility is needed, who has already started, powered by new
              technologies and services. The mobility of the future will be electrified, connected, personalized,
              automated and software defined.<br/>
              Software is more and more dominating our daily life, also in the automotive world. Almost every
              function in the vehicle is defined by software. Autonomous Driving solutions introduce a new complexity
              into the development of embedded systems in the vehicle. This complexity rises with each level of
              control and autonomy of the automated driving systems and you need deeper expertise and more
              software. Software is more and more becoming an important differentiator for autonomous vehicles.
              Increasing embedded software complexity with an increase in level of automation is putting new
              demands on the existing tools and frameworks. Instead of solving these challenges alone, partnering in
              non-differentiating areas and collaborating is the path forward.</p>

             <p>The mobility landscape is undergoing significant changes. More and more mobility providers compete
             for customers with their own mobility services. Traditional public transport, demand responsive transport, 
             taxis, car sharing, ride pooling, bike sharing, e-scooters,  … the available modes of transport in cities 
             are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and confusing. At the same time, significant changes to the landscape 
             are induced by the effects of the global pandemic. They may lead to even more drastic changes in the mobility 
             demand.</p>
             <p>How to tame the complexity of this landscape and fight the climate change without neglecting mobility as a 
             fundamental human need is an open - albeit essential - question.</p>
             <p>In this talk, we will examine the changes in the mobility landscape and look at the role of two important 
             players in this discussion: open simulators and artificial intelligence. What do they bring to the table 
             in order to tackle the rising complexity? How can they be applied to improve the transportation system in 
             a city? The Eclipse SUMO project is used as an example to illustrate how to build digital twins of smart cities. 
             Moreover, results from recent research projects are used to discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of applying 
             artificial intelligence to optimize transportation systems.</p>
